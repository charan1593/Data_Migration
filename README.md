Data Migration : In this task involving different database operations like creating tables by using json datacatalog in default sqlite3 database and inserting dummy data in the created tables in sqlite3, after that extracting the data from the tables and migrated the same schema data into newly created target database(i.e, New sqlite3 database)
Requirements: -Python 3.x -pandas -OpenAI library
Usage: -Ensure you have Python and pandas installed on your system. -Place the provided script in your working directory. -Import the script into your Python environment.  -run requirements file: pip install -r requirements.txt -run main.py file.
Functionality -I haved created three python scripted files for different operations. In that table_creation.py file script is used for creating tables with using OpenAI and reading the json file by using the pandas and another file table_data_insertion.py is used for data insertion(In this scenario i'm using 150 dummy records) and extract_and_migrate file is used for extraction and migration the data to database and .env file is used for securely accessing OpenAI API key and database credentials.Finally the task is about extract and migrate data from one database to another database(For this case  i'm using inbuilt sqlite3 for both databases.)
